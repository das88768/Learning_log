# Learning_log
My first app- Learning_log with Python and Django.
From the book Python crash course by Eric-Matthews.
The purpose of this project is to learn how to make real projects with python and with the use of Django.
Most of the code is from the above described book!, but I also develop most the code to look the app different from the main app.
I customized the app in very good way with bootstrap4.

This Project has been deployed to the Heroku, go and check it - [Link](https://log-the-learning.herokuapp.com/)
